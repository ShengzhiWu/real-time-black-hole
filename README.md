# Real-time Black Hole Based on WebGL
This is a real-time black hole visualization based on WebGL.

[Try it](https://shengzhiwu.github.io/black-hole.html) directly on my GitHub Page (It runs slowly. Even if you have a high-performance GPU like NVIDIA RTX 4090, please try to rescale the browser window, making it smaller, if you are using a high resolution screen).
